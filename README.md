# clean-webpage-startup
A clean startup for when you start a front end website. Which provides fonts that are publicly available, and free for commercial use.
Perfect for students/starters that want to start developing quickly, without having to worry about Viewport or browser related shenanigans.

- No hassle
- No novility
- just a clean starting point for a basic webpage

This package also includes a gitignore file that covers the most common IDE's and frameworks for front end development. 
Feel free to add stuff to it.

### Bonus
A simple bonus class was added to help new devs center their contents within a container.
Just add **flex-mid** to your container, and you're done. 

#### Enjoy!
